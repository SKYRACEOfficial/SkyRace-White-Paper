When it comes to sports, phrases like adrenaline, passion, perspiration, and chasing will come to mind unconsciously.The prediction of wins and losses, which is always interlaced with the game of greed and rationality among humanity, is another significant temptation of sports. Human instinct has led to the evolution of sports into a wealth game.
The prediction market has a trillion-dollar global market share, according to statistics.  And in China, there are about 4 trillion people engaged in online and offline prediction events every year. Chinese soccer lottery sales alone exceeded 12.8 billion yuan during the World Cup in Brazil eight years ago. Therefore, it is not surprising that the upcoming 2022 World Cup in Qatar is likely to reverse the downturn of the global economy.

Wild development, however, is always fraught with danger.
With the rapid expansion of the prediction market, the negatives of online prediction activities are gradually coming obvious: technical flaws, shady operations, irregular guarantees, platform fraud, illegal financing, and other phenomena have appeared. The highly centralized intervention makes it even more challenging for users to benefit from their participation.
In addition, the unique character of the prediction industry— a lack of regulation, the platform team absconding with the fund, and other issues are common—making it tough for the entire prediction industry to make another breakthrough. Furthermore, there is no place for those users to protect their rights who have endured unfair cases or even fraud.
